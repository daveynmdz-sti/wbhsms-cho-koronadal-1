# Lab Upload Functionality Fix

## Issue Resolved
**Error:** `Uncaught ReferenceError: uploadSingleResult is not defined`

## Root Cause
The `uploadSingleResult` function was defined inside the quick upload modal's JavaScript context, but the onclick handlers were trying to access it from the main page's global scope.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Functions to Main Page
```javascript
function uploadSingleResult(labOrderItemId) {
    console.log('uploadSingleResult called with item ID:', labOrderItemId);
    closeModal('quickUploadModal');
    setTimeout(() => {
        uploadResult(labOrderItemId);
    }, 100);
}
```

### 2. Made Functions Globally Accessible
```javascript
window.uploadResult = uploadResult;
window.uploadSingleResult = uploadSingleResult;
window.downloadResult = downloadResult;
```

### 3. Proper Function Flow
1. **Quick Upload Button Clicked** → `showQuickUpload(labOrderId)`
2. **Loads Quick Upload Modal** → Shows all test items for the order
3. **Upload Result Button Clicked** → `uploadSingleResult(itemId)`
4. **Closes Quick Modal** → Calls main `uploadResult(itemId)`
5. **Opens Upload Form Modal** → Standard upload interface

## Current Upload Methods Available

### Method 1: Traditional View → Upload
1. Click "View" button in lab orders table

### Method 2: Quick Upload (NEW)
