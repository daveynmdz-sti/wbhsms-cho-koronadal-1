# Root Directory Cleanup Summary
*Date: October 14, 2025*

## Files Moved from Root to `/tests/` Directory

The following test and debug files were moved from the root directory to the appropriate `/tests/` folder for better organization:

### Queue Testing Files
- `debug_queue.php` → `tests/debug_queue.php`
- `debug_queue_status.php` → `tests/debug_queue_status.php`
- `debug_simulation.php` → `tests/debug_simulation.php`
- `queue_test.php` → `tests/queue_test.php`
- `simple_queue_test.php` → `tests/simple_queue_test.php`
- `working_queue_simulation.php` → `tests/working_queue_simulation.php`

### Patient Flow Testing Files
- `test_complete_patient_flow.php` → `tests/test_complete_patient_flow.php`
- `test_station_interfaces.php` → `tests/test_station_interfaces.php`

### System Testing Files
- `test_critical_fixes.php` → `tests/test_critical_fixes.php`
- `test_routing_fix.php` → `tests/test_routing_fix.php`
- `test_queue_setup.php` → `tests/test_queue_setup.php`

## Files Removed

- `test_db.php` - Removed as redundant (more comprehensive version exists as `tests/testdb.php`)

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files
- `tests/README.md` - Added documentation for all newly moved queue testing files
- `README.md` - Updated references to point to correct locations:
  - Database test references now point to `/scripts/setup/testdb.php`
  - Added mention of queue system tests in `/tests/` folder
  - Removed outdated file structure references

## Result

The root directory is now clean and properly organized with only essential files:

```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**: Only essential files remain in root
2. **Better Organization**: All testing files are now properly categorized
3. **Improved Navigation**: Easier to find and manage test files
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All tests are still accessible and functional
5. **Updated Documentation**: All references are corrected and current

## Access Instructions

- **For setup testing**: Use `/scripts/setup/testdb.php`
- **For queue testing**: Browse `/tests/` directory for comprehensive queue system tests
- **For general testing**: All testing utilities are documented in `/tests/README.md`
