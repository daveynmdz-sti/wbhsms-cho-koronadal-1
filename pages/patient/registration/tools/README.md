## ÔøΩ Password Double-Hashing Fix (October 2025)

### Issue Identified
A critical bug was discovered where patient passwords were being hashed twice during registration:
1. First hash in `register_patient.php` (correct)
2. Second hash in `registration_otp.php` (incorrect - double hashing)

This caused patients to be unable to login after successful registration.

### Fix Applied
**File:** `pages/patient/registration/registration_otp.php`
**Line 85 changed from:**
```php
$hashedPassword = password_hash($regData['password'], PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
```
**To:**
```php
$hashedPassword = $regData['password']; // Already hashed in register_patient.php
```

### Tools for This Fix
- `debug_password_hashing.php` - Diagnose the double-hashing issue
- `fix_double_hashed_passwords.php` - Identify and fix affected patients
- `test_password_fix.php` - Verify the fix works correctly

## ÔøΩüìù When to Use These Tools

### During Development:
- Use `system_check.php` to verify all components are working
- Use `debug_registration.php` for quick troubleshooting
- Use `test_registration_no_email.php` to test database logic
- Use `test_registration.php` to view system overview and structure
- Use `debug_password_hashing.php` to verify password handling
- Check `mail_error.log` for email delivery issues

### After Password Fix:
- Run `fix_double_hashed_passwords.php` to check for affected patients
- Use `test_password_fix.php` to verify new registrations work
- Test login functionality with newly registered patients

### Before Deployment:
- Run `system_check.php` to ensure production readiness
- Verify all tests pass before going live

### Troubleshooting Issues:
- Check `debug_registration.php` for immediate diagnostics
- Review system health with `system_check.php`
- Check `mail_error.log` for email authentication problems
- Test specific components individually
