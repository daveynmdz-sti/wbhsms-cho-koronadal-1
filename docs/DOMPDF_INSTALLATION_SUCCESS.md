## 🎉 SUCCESS! PDF Generation Fully Restored

The dompdf installation issue has been **completely resolved**. All Composer dependencies were already properly installed, and the system has been configured to work correctly.

## 🔧 What Was Done

### 1. **Dependencies Verified** ✅

### 4. **Testing Tools Created** ✅
