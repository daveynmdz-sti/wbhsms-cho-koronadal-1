# Patient Flow System - Healthcare Workflow

## 🔄 Complete Patient Journey Flow

The system now implements a proper healthcare workflow where patients move through multiple stations before completing their visit.

### Patient Flow Process:

```
1. CHECK-IN → TRIAGE → CONSULTATION → [LAB/PHARMACY] → COMPLETE
```

### Station-Specific Actions:

#### 🏥 **Triage Station**
- **Actions**: Call Next, Skip, No-Show, Complete Service
- **Flow**: Patient moves to Primary Care/Doctor after triage

#### 👨‍⚕️ **Primary Care/Doctor Station (Consultation)**
- **Route to Lab**: Send patient for tests (CBC, X-ray, etc.)
- **Route to Pharmacy**: Provide prescription for medication
- **Complete Visit**: End patient care (no further treatment needed)

#### 🔬 **Laboratory Station**
- **Return to Doctor**: Send back with test results for further consultation
- **Complete Visit**: End care if no doctor follow-up needed

#### 💊 **Pharmacy Station**
- **Complete Visit**: End care after dispensing medication

### Key Features:

✅ **Proper Routing**: Patients flow through appropriate stations based on medical needs
✅ **Queue Management**: Each station maintains its own queue with proper numbering
✅ **Audit Trail**: All patient movements are logged with timestamps and notes
✅ **Flexible Workflow**: Doctors can route patients to multiple stations as needed
✅ **Complete Visit**: Only designated stations can actually complete the patient visit

### Usage Instructions:

1. **Check-in patients** at the Check-in Counter - they automatically go to Triage
2. **Triage staff** assess and send patients to Primary Care
3. **Doctors** examine patients and decide next steps:
   - Send to Lab for tests
   - Send to Pharmacy for medication
   - Complete visit if no further treatment needed
4. **Lab staff** complete tests and either:
   - Return patient to Doctor with results
   - Complete visit if no follow-up needed
5. **Pharmacy staff** dispense medication and complete the visit

### Benefits:

- ✅ **No More Premature Completions**: Patients can't be marked complete until they've gone through the proper workflow
- ✅ **Better Patient Care**: Ensures patients receive all necessary treatments
- ✅ **Improved Tracking**: Full audit trail of patient movement through the system
- ✅ **Staff Efficiency**: Clear workflow reduces confusion and improves coordination
- ✅ **Queue Accuracy**: Real-time queue status reflects actual patient flow

### Technical Implementation:

- **Database**: New routing methods in `QueueManagementService`
- **UI**: Station-specific buttons based on healthcare workflow
- **Backend**: Proper queue entry creation and completion logic
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for compliance

This system ensures patients follow the proper healthcare workflow and prevents them from being marked as "completed" prematurely.
