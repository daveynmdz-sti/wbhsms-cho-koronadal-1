# Queue Management System Integration

## 🎯 Overview

This system integrates queue management with the existing appointments module, allowing patients to receive queue numbers when booking appointments and enabling staff to manage patient flow efficiently.

## 📋 Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Queue Generation**
- Queue entries are automatically created when appointments are booked
- Sequential queue numbers assigned per time slot and queue type
- Priority levels based on patient status (PWD/Senior = Priority)

### 2. **Queue Status Management**
- Real-time queue status tracking (waiting, in_progress, done, cancelled, no_show)
- Staff can update queue status through API
- Automatic logging of all queue actions

### 3. **Patient Experience**
- Patients see their queue number on appointment cards
- Queue status displayed in patient portal
- No need to physically check in early

### 4. **Staff Management**
- API endpoints for queue management
- Queue statistics and reporting
- Reinstatement capability for no-show patients

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Appointment Booking
1. Patient books appointment through existing form
2. System creates appointment record
3. **NEW:** System automatically creates queue entry
4. **NEW:** Queue number and status displayed to patient

### 2. Patient Arrival
1. Patient arrives at facility
2. Staff can see patient in queue system
3. Queue status shows "waiting"

### 3. Staff Management
1. Staff calls patient (status → "in_progress")
2. Service completed (status → "done")
3. No-shows marked automatically or manually
4. All actions logged with timestamps

### 4. Queue Monitoring
1. Real-time queue display for staff
2. Statistics for management
3. Historical data for analysis

## 🎨 Queue Number Format

- **Format:** Sequential numbers per queue type and date
- **Example:** Patient booking consultation on 2025-10-02 gets Queue #1, #2, #3, etc.
- **Reset:** Numbers reset daily per queue type
- **Priority:** PWD/Senior patients get priority level but keep sequential numbers

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify integration:
```
http://localhost/wbhsms-cho-koronadal/test_queue_integration.php
```

The test verifies:
- Queue tables exist and are accessible
- Appointments create queue entries automatically
- Queue logs are being generated
- Queue service functions correctly

## 📊 Queue Types

The system supports multiple queue types:
- **consultation** - Doctor consultations
- **triage** - Initial patient assessment
- **lab** - Laboratory services
- **prescription** - Pharmacy/medication dispensing
- **billing** - Payment processing
- **document** - Document requests/processing
