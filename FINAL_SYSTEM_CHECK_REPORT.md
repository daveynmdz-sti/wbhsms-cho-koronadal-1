# Final System Check Report
## CHO Koronadal Queue Management System

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ SYSTEM READY - All Critical Issues Resolved

---

## Issues Found and Fixed ✅

### 1. **JavaScript Include Errors** - ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** PHP files were incorrectly included as JavaScript files
- `<script src="../../utils/queue_code_formatter.php"></script>` ❌
- **Fix:** Removed incorrect PHP script includes and added JavaScript implementations

**Files Fixed:**
- admin_monitor.php
- public_display_selector.php  
- dashboard.php
- setup_stations.php
- checkin.php

### 2. **Missing JavaScript Functions** - ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** `formatQueueCodeForDisplay()` function was missing in JavaScript
- **Fix:** Added JavaScript implementation to all files that need it

```javascript
function formatQueueCodeForDisplay(queueCode) {
    if (!queueCode) return '';
    const parts = queueCode.split('-');
    if (parts.length >= 3) {
        const timeSlot = parts[1];
        const sequence = parts[2];
        if (timeSlot.length === 3) {
            const hours = timeSlot.substring(0, 2);
            const slotLetter = timeSlot.substring(2);
            const minuteMap = { 'A': '00', 'B': '15', 'C': '30', 'D': '45' };
            const minutes = minuteMap[slotLetter] || '00';
            return `${hours}${minutes.charAt(0)}-${sequence}`;
        }
        return `${timeSlot}-${sequence}`;
    }
    return queueCode;
}
```

### 3. **Database Table Safety** - ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** `station_configurations` table might not exist
- **Fix:** Added table existence check with graceful fallback

```php
$table_check = $pdo->query("SHOW TABLES LIKE 'station_configurations'");
if ($table_check->rowCount() > 0) {
    // Proceed with configuration
} else {
    // Log graceful message and continue
}
```
