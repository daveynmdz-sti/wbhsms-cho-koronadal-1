# Multi-Facility Booking Implementation ✅

## Overview
Updated the appointment booking system to allow **multiple facility bookings on the same day**, enabling patients to book at BHC, DHO, and CHO on the same day, provided each booking is for a different facility.

## 🔧 **Changes Implemented**

### 1. **Updated book_appointment.php** ✅

#### **Added Helper Function:**
```php
function hasAppointmentForFacility($conn, $patient_id, $facility_id, $date) {
    // Checks if patient already has appointment for specific facility on given date
}
```

#### **New Facility Availability Logic:**
- **OLD**: Blocked all same-day bookings if any active referral existed
- **NEW**: Only blocks booking if patient already has appointment for that specific facility on that date

```php
// BHC: Enable if no appointment today for patient's BHC
$facility_availability['bhc_enabled'] = !hasAppointmentForFacility($conn, $patient_id, $patient_barangay_facility_id, $today);

// DHO: Enable if referral exists AND no appointment today for DHO
$facility_availability['dho_enabled'] = ($facility_data['dho_referrals'] > 0) && 
                                      !hasAppointmentForFacility($conn, $patient_id, 3, $today);

// CHO: Enable if referral exists AND no appointment today for CHO  
$facility_availability['cho_enabled'] = ($facility_data['cho_referrals'] > 0) && 
                                       !hasAppointmentForFacility($conn, $patient_id, 1, $today);
```

#### **Dynamic BHC Facility ID:**
- Maps patient's barangay to their respective BHC facility
- Fallback to facility_id 25 (Avanceña BHC) if mapping not found

### 2. **Updated submit_appointment.php** ✅

#### **Removed Cross-Facility Time Conflict:**
- **OLD**: Prevented booking at different facilities if same date/time
- **NEW**: Allows booking at different facilities on same day

#### **Updated Duplicate Check:**
- **OLD**: Checked for same facility + same date + same time
- **NEW**: Checks for same facility + same date (any time)

```php
// New validation: One appointment per facility per day
$stmt = $conn->prepare("
    SELECT COUNT(*) as existing_count
    FROM appointments 
    WHERE patient_id = ? AND facility_id = ? AND scheduled_date = ? AND status = 'confirmed'
");
```

#### **Error Message Update:**
- **OLD**: "You already have an appointment at [facility] for this date and time"
- **NEW**: "You already have an appointment at [facility] for this date. You can only book one appointment per facility per day"

## 📋 **New Booking Rules**

### **✅ What's Now Allowed:**
1. **Multiple facility bookings on same day**
   - BHC at 9:00 AM
   - DHO at 11:00 AM  
   - CHO at 1:00 PM
   
2. **Different time slots per facility**
   - Each facility can have different appointment times
   
3. **Referral-based progression**
   - BHC → get referral → DHO → get referral → CHO

### **🚫 What's Still Restricted:**
1. **One appointment per facility per day**
   - Can't book BHC twice on same day
   - Can't book DHO twice on same day
   - Can't book CHO twice on same day

2. **Referral requirements maintained**
   - DHO requires active referral to facilities 2 or 3
   - CHO requires active referral to facility 1

3. **Time slot capacity limits**
   - Maximum 20 patients per time slot per facility

## 🧪 **Testing Tools Created**

1. **test_multi_facility_booking.php**
   - Validates helper function
   - Shows current appointments
   - Simulates booking logic
   - Checks referral requirements

## 💡 **Example Valid Workflow**

**Avanceña Resident Same-Day Journey:**

```
8:00 AM  - Book appointment at BHC Avanceña (facility_id=25)
9:00 AM  - Visit BHC, receive care
9:30 AM  - Doctor refers patient to DHO for specialist consultation
10:00 AM - Book appointment at DHO (facility_id=3) for 11:00 AM
11:00 AM - Visit DHO, receive specialist care  
11:30 AM - Specialist refers patient to CHO for advanced procedure
12:00 PM - Book appointment at CHO (facility_id=1) for 1:00 PM
1:00 PM  - Visit CHO for advanced care
```
