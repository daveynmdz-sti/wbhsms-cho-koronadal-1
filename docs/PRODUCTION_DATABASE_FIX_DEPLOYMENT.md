# ðŸš€ PRODUCTION DATABASE FIX - Deployment Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ PROBLEM RESOLVED
**Root Cause:** The system was **not properly detecting production environment** and was connecting to localhost database instead of your production database server (`31.97.106.60:3307`).

## ðŸ“‹ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Upload Updated Files to Production Server

Upload these **3 critical files** to your production server:

1. **`config/db.php`** - Updated database configuration with production detection
2. **`config/env.php`** - Updated environment detection
3. **`test_db_environment.php`** - Database diagnostic tool (for testing)

### Step 2: Create Production Environment File

On your production server, create a file called **`.env`** in the root directory with this content:

```env
# Production Environment Configuration
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Database Configuration for Production
DB_HOST=31.97.106.60
DB_PORT=3307
DB_DATABASE=wbhsms_database
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

# Application Settings
APP_DEBUG=1
APP_ENV=production
APP_NAME="WBHSMS CHO Koronadal"
APP_URL=http://31.97.106.60
```

### Step 3: Test Database Connection

1. **Access the diagnostic tool:** `http://31.97.106.60/test_db_environment.php`
2. **Verify these show correctly:**
   - âœ… **Environment:** Should show "PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT DETECTED"
   - âœ… **Database Host:** Should show `31.97.106.60`
   - âœ… **Database Port:** Should show `3307`
   - âœ… **Connection Status:** Should show "MySQLi connection successful"
   - âœ… **Patient Count:** Should show patients from production database

### Step 4: Test Patient Lab Interface

1. **Login as patient P000007** (David Diaz)
2. **Navigate to Lab Tests** page
3. **Verify lab orders appear** in the table
4. **Test "View" button** to ensure modal opens correctly

## ðŸ”§ WHAT WAS FIXED

### Environment Detection Logic
**Before:**
```php
$is_local = ($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] === 'localhost');
// Only checked SERVER_NAME, missed production IP
```

**After:**
```php
$is_production = (isset($_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR']) && $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] === '31.97.106.60') ||
                 (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) && strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], '31.97.106.60') !== false) ||
                 (getenv('ENVIRONMENT') === 'production');
// Properly detects your production server
```

### Database Configuration
**Production Settings (Auto-Applied):**
- **Host:** `31.97.106.60` (your production server)
- **Port:** `3307` (your production port)  
- **Database:** `wbhsms_database`
- **User:** `root`

**Local Settings (When on localhost):**
- **Host:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `3306`
- **Database:** `wbhsms_database`
- **User:** `root`

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VERIFICATION

### Production Diagnostic Checklist:
- [ ] Environment shows "PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT DETECTED"
- [ ] Database connects to `31.97.106.60:3307`
- [ ] Patient count shows production data (not zero)
- [ ] Sample patients include P000007, P000016, etc.
- [ ] Lab orders count shows production lab orders

### Patient Interface Verification:
- [ ] Patient P000007 sees their lab orders
- [ ] "View" buttons work and show modals
- [ ] Lab results section shows completed tests
- [ ] File download buttons are functional

## ðŸ’¡ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Environment Still Shows "LOCAL":
1. Check that `.env` file exists on production server
2. Verify `ENVIRONMENT=production` is set in `.env`
3. Check server IP matches `31.97.106.60`

### If Database Connection Fails:
1. Verify database server `31.97.106.60:3307` is accessible
2. Check database credentials in `.env` file
3. Ensure `wbhsms_database` exists on production server
4. Test connection manually from production server

### If Lab Orders Still Don't Show:
1. Verify patient P000007 exists in production database
2. Check that lab orders exist for that patient_id
3. Verify patient_id format (should be string like "P000007")
4. Test API endpoints directly: `/pages/patient/laboratory/get_lab_order_details.php?id=[order_id]`

## ðŸŽ‰ EXPECTED RESULT

After deployment, your production patient lab interface should:

1. **Automatically connect** to production database (`31.97.106.60:3307`)
2. **Show lab orders** for logged-in patients  
3. **Display "View" buttons** that open detailed modals
4. **Enable file downloads** for completed lab results
5. **Work seamlessly** with existing patient authentication

The system will now properly distinguish between your localhost development environment and production server, connecting to the correct database in each case.

## ðŸ“ž DEPLOYMENT SUPPORT

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Run the diagnostic tool first: `test_db_environment.php`
2. Check the environment detection results
3. Verify database connection status
4. Test with patient P000007 specifically

The fix ensures **automatic environment detection** so no manual configuration changes are needed when deploying between localhost and production.
