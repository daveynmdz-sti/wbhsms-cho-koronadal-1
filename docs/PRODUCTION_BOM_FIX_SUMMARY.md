# Production Header/Session Issues - BOM Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The production environment was showing "headers already sent" errors specifically:
```
Warning: ini_set(): Session ini settings cannot be changed after headers have already been sent
Output started at billing_reports.php:1
```

This error indicates that PHP files contain BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters at the beginning, which are invisible but cause PHP to output content before any header() or ini_set() calls.

## Root Cause
BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters in PHP files, specifically UTF-8 BOM (EF BB BF bytes) at the start of files, causing "output started at file.php:1" errors.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Created clean versions of all affected files** without BOM encoding:
   - `pages/management/cashier/billing_reports.php` ✅
   - `pages/management/cashier/billing_management.php` ✅ 
   - `api/create_invoice.php` ✅
   - `api/process_payment.php` ✅
   - `api/get_patient_invoices.php` ✅
   - `config/session/employee_session.php` ✅

2. **Added output buffering protection** in all PHP files:
   ```php
   <?php
   ob_start(); // Start output buffering to prevent header issues
   // ... rest of code ...
   ob_end_flush(); // End output buffering
   ?>
   ```

3. **Enhanced session configuration** with proper header checks and buffering.

## Files Fixed
| Original File | Status | Action |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| `billing_reports.php` | ✅ Fixed | Replaced with BOM-free version + output buffering |
| `billing_management.php` | ✅ Fixed | Replaced with BOM-free version + output buffering |
| `create_invoice.php` | ✅ Fixed | Replaced with BOM-free version + output buffering |
| `process_payment.php` | ✅ Fixed | Replaced with BOM-free version + output buffering |
| `get_patient_invoices.php` | ✅ Fixed | Replaced with BOM-free version + output buffering |
| `employee_session.php` | ✅ Fixed | Replaced with BOM-free version + output buffering |

## Backup Created
Original files backed up to: `backup_bom_fix_20251021_031752/`

## Testing Instructions
1. **Local Testing:**
   - Open: http://localhost/wbhsms-cho-koronadal-1/pages/management/login.php
   - Login as Admin or Cashier
   - Navigate to Billing Management
   - Verify no "headers already sent" errors appear

2. **Production Deployment:**
   - Upload the clean files to your production server
   - Replace the original files with the clean versions
   - Test the billing system functionality

## Production Deployment Commands
For your Hostinger VPS or production server:

```bash
# SSH into your server and navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Replace files (backup originals first if needed)
cp pages/management/cashier/billing_management_clean.php pages/management/cashier/billing_management.php
cp pages/management/cashier/billing_reports_clean.php pages/management/cashier/billing_reports.php
cp api/create_invoice_clean.php api/create_invoice.php
cp api/process_payment_clean.php api/process_payment.php
cp api/get_patient_invoices_clean.php api/get_patient_invoices.php
cp config/session/employee_session_clean.php config/session/employee_session.php

# Set proper permissions
chmod 644 pages/management/cashier/*.php
chmod 644 api/*.php
chmod 644 config/session/*.php
```

## Prevention
To prevent BOM issues in the future:
1. **Use UTF-8 without BOM encoding** in your code editor
2. **Configure your editor** (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.) to save PHP files as "UTF-8" not "UTF-8 with BOM"
3. **Always use output buffering** in PHP files that send headers
4. **Test locally first** before deploying to production

## Verification
The fix is successful if:
- ✅ No "headers already sent" errors in browser
- ✅ No "output started at file.php:1" messages
- ✅ Billing system functions normally
- ✅ Session management works properly
- ✅ No PHP warnings in error logs

## Next Steps
1. Test the billing system locally
2. If working properly, deploy to production using the commands above
3. Monitor production error logs for any remaining issues
4. Update your development workflow to prevent BOM in future files
