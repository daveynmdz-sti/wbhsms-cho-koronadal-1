## Doctor Queue Management Access - Implementation Guide

### Overview
This implementation provides a streamlined queue management experience for doctors by:

1. **Direct Access**: Doctors go directly to their assigned consultation station
2. **Station-Based Permissions**: Only assigned doctors can access queue management
3. **Graceful Handling**: Unassigned doctors see a clear message and cannot access queue functions
4. **Visual Feedback**: Sidebar shows station assignment status

### How It Works

#### For Assigned Doctors
- ‚úÖ **Sidebar Link**: Shows "Queue Management" with station name
- ‚úÖ **Direct Access**: Links directly to `consultation_station.php`
- ‚úÖ **Full Functionality**: Can manage their assigned consultation station queue

#### For Unassigned Doctors  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disabled Link**: Sidebar shows "No station assigned" with disabled styling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clear Message**: Clicking shows alert about needing station assignment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocked Access**: Cannot access queue management functions

#### For Admins
- üëë **Full Access**: Can access any consultation station
- üëë **Station Selection**: Can switch between stations if needed

### Database Requirements

#### Required Table: `assignment_schedules`
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS assignment_schedules (
    assignment_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,
    station_id INT NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NULL,
    is_active TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1,
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (station_id) REFERENCES stations(station_id)
);
```

#### Required Table: `stations`
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stations (
    station_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    station_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    station_type ENUM('checkin','triage','consultation','lab','pharmacy','billing','document') NOT NULL,
    is_active TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Admin Setup Instructions

#### 1. Create Consultation Stations
```sql
-- Insert consultation stations
INSERT INTO stations (station_name, station_type, is_active) VALUES 
('General Consultation', 'consultation', 1),
('Dental Consultation', 'consultation', 1),
('Pediatric Consultation', 'consultation', 1);
```

#### 2. Assign Doctor to Station
```sql
-- Assign doctor EMP00002 to General Consultation
INSERT INTO assignment_schedules (employee_id, station_id, start_date, is_active) 
VALUES (
    (SELECT employee_id FROM employees WHERE employee_number = 'EMP00002'),
    (SELECT station_id FROM stations WHERE station_name = 'General Consultation'),
    CURDATE(),
    1
);
```

#### 3. Verify Assignment
```sql
-- Check doctor assignments
SELECT 
    e.employee_number,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    s.station_name,
    sch.start_date,
    sch.end_date,
    sch.is_active
FROM assignment_schedules sch
JOIN employees e ON sch.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN stations s ON sch.station_id = s.station_id
WHERE s.station_type = 'consultation'
AND sch.is_active = 1;
```

### User Experience Flow

#### ‚úÖ **Assigned Doctor Experience**
1. **Login** ‚Üí Doctor dashboard
2. **Sidebar** ‚Üí "Queue Management" shows station name
3. **Click** ‚Üí Goes directly to consultation station interface
4. **Full Access** ‚Üí Can manage queue, call patients, route patients

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unassigned Doctor Experience**  
1. **Login** ‚Üí Doctor dashboard
2. **Sidebar** ‚Üí "Queue Management" shows "No station assigned"
3. **Click** ‚Üí Alert: "Contact administrator for station assignment"
4. **Blocked** ‚Üí Cannot access queue functions

#### üëë **Admin Experience**
1. **Login** ‚Üí Admin dashboard  
2. **Full Access** ‚Üí Can access any station
3. **Station Management** ‚Üí Can assign doctors to stations

### Troubleshooting

#### Doctor Can't Access Queue Management
**Check**:
```sql
-- Verify doctor has active station assignment
SELECT 
    e.employee_number,
    s.station_name,
    sch.start_date,
    sch.end_date,
    sch.is_active
FROM assignment_schedules sch
JOIN employees e ON sch.employee_id = e.employee_id  
JOIN stations s ON sch.station_id = s.station_id
WHERE e.employee_number = 'EMP00002'
AND s.station_type = 'consultation'
AND sch.is_active = 1;
```

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Assign doctor to consultation station
INSERT INTO assignment_schedules (employee_id, station_id, start_date, is_active)
VALUES (
    (SELECT employee_id FROM employees WHERE employee_number = 'EMP00002'),
    (SELECT station_id FROM stations WHERE station_name = 'General Consultation'),
    CURDATE(),
    1
);
```

#### Doctor Sees Wrong Station
**Fix**:
```sql
-- Update assignment to correct station
UPDATE assignment_schedules 
SET station_id = (SELECT station_id FROM stations WHERE station_name = 'Correct Station Name')
WHERE employee_id = (SELECT employee_id FROM employees WHERE employee_number = 'EMP00002')
AND is_active = 1;
```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **üéØ Focused UX**: Doctors go directly to their work area
2. **üîí Security**: Database-driven access control
3. **üì± Clear Feedback**: Users know exactly what they can/cannot do
4. **‚ö° Performance**: No unnecessary station selection overhead
5. **üõ°Ô∏è Error Prevention**: Impossible to access wrong station by mistake
6. **üìã Admin Control**: Centralized station assignment management

### Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Station Support**: Allow doctors to be assigned to multiple stations
- **Time-Based Assignments**: Schedule-based station assignments  
- **Rotation Management**: Automatic station rotation for doctors
- **Mobile Notifications**: Alerts when queue needs attention
