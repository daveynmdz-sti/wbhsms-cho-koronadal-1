## 👩‍⚕️ Normal Patient Flow (PhilHealth Members)

**Applies to services with:**  
`service_id IN ('1','2','3','4','6','7')`

**Flow:**  
`[16] Check-In Counter → [1-3] Triage → [5-11] Consultation/Treatment → [13] Laboratory or [14-15] Dispensing → END QUEUE`

**Details:**  
- Billing [4] is skipped since PhilHealth covers these services.
- After consultation, the doctor decides whether the patient:
  - Proceeds to Laboratory [13] for diagnostics, or
  - Goes to Dispensing [14-15] for prescribed medication.
- The system automatically updates the queue based on the doctor's action.

**✅ Implementation Status:** Fully tested and working. All routing operations verified.

---

## 💰 Non-PhilHealth Patient Flow

**Applies to services with:**  
`service_id IN ('1','2','3','4','6','7')`

**Flow:**  
`[16] Check-In Counter → [1-3] Triage → [5-11] Consultation/Treatment → [4] Billing → [5-11] Consultation/Treatment → [13] Laboratory or [14-15] Dispensing → END QUEUE`

**Details:**  
- After the initial consultation, the patient must visit Billing [4] to pay before continuing treatment or lab tests.
- Once payment is confirmed, the patient is requeued to Consultation/Treatment [5-11] to complete the medical process.

**✅ Implementation Status:** Routing logic implemented and tested.

---

## 🔬 Laboratory Test-Only Flow

**Applies to patients with:**  
`service_id = '8'`

| PhilHealth Status | Flow |
|-------------------|------|
| ✅ Member         | `[16] Check-In Counter → [1-3] Triage → [13] Laboratory → END QUEUE` |
| ❌ Non-Member     | `[16] Check-In Counter → [1-3] Triage → [4] Billing → [13] Laboratory → END QUEUE` |

**Notes:**  
- Billing applies only to non-PhilHealth members before proceeding to lab testing.
- Laboratory station handles both specimen collection and result upload.

**✅ Implementation Status:** Laboratory routing verified and working.

---

## 📄 Medical Document Request Flow

**Applies to patients with:**  
`service_id = '9'`

**Flow (for all patients):**  
`[16] Check-In Counter → [4] Billing → [12] Medical Document Requests → END QUEUE`

**Notes:**  
- All document requests (e.g., medical certificates) are billable, regardless of PhilHealth status.
- Document processing begins only after successful billing confirmation.

**✅ Implementation Status:** Document station routing implemented.
